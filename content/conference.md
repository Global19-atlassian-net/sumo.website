### Introduction
Traffic simulations are of immense importance for researchers as well as practitioners in the field of transportation. SUMO has been available since 2001 and provides a wide range of traffic planning and simulation applications. SUMO consists of a suite of tools covering road network imports and enrichment, demand generation and assignment, and a state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulator capable of simulating private and public transport modes, as well as person-based trip chains. Being open source, SUMO is easily extensible by new behavioral models and can be dynamically controlled via a well-defined programming interface. These and other features make SUMO one of the most often used open source traffic simulators with a large and international user community.

### Call for Papers
The conference focuses on presenting new and unique results in the field of mobility simulation and modeling using openly available tools and data. We expect a large variety of research topics and usage approaches. If you are working on a research project fitting the topics below, you are kindly invited to submit an abstract. Possible areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Mobility and Demand Modelling
- Traffic Simulation
- Open Tools and Open Data
- Modelling Urban Mobility
- Traffic Applications
- Traffic Management Solutions
- Intermodal Transport
- Autonomous Driving
- Logistics Simulation
- Vehicular Communication
- E-Mobility

#### Paper Submission

**Only for invited Authors of scientific papers:** Please submit your final paper using EasyChair https://easychair.org/ until **14.09.2020** using a template from https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors. We will try to give feedback shortly after.
