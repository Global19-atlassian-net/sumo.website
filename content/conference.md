### Introduction
Traffic simulations are of immense importance for researchers as well as practitioners in the field of transportation. SUMO has been available since 2001 and provides a wide range of traffic planning and simulation applications. SUMO consists of a suite of tools covering road network imports and enrichment, demand generation and assignment, and a state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulator capable of simulating private and public transport modes, as well as person-based trip chains. Being open source, SUMO is easily extensible by new behavioral models and can be dynamically controlled via a well-defined programming interface. These and other features make SUMO one of the most often used open source traffic simulators with a large and international user community.

### Call for Papers
The conference focuses on presenting new and unique results in the field of mobility simulation and modeling using openly available tools and data. We expect a large variety of research topics and usage approaches. If you are working on a research project fitting the topics below, you are kindly invited to submit an abstract. Possible areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Mobility and Demand Modelling
- Traffic Simulation
- Open Tools and Open Data
- Modelling Urban Mobility
- Traffic Applications
- Traffic Management Solutions
- Intermodal Transport
- Autonomous Driving
- Logistics Simulation
- Vehicular Communication
- E-Mobility

#### Paper Submission

Please submit your final paper using EasyChair https://easychair.org/ until **14.09.2020** using a template from https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors. We will try to give feedback shortly after.

### Agenda

The new Agenda is coming soon...

<!-- Unfortunately, due to the current corona situation we decided to postpone the SUMO user conference. We are very interested in networking with all conference participants therefore we did not want to cancel the conference. Please save the new date for the SUMO conference: **26.-28. October 2020**

At the moment we see no other option and we are very sorry for any inconveniences.
